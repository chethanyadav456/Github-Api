## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please follow the steps below:

1. **Do not report security vulnerabilities publicly.** Please refrain from submitting issues about security concerns on GitHub. This helps prevent potential attacks before a patch can be applied.
  
2. **Send us a detailed report.**  
   - Email: [chethanyadav456@gmail.com](mailto:chethanyadav456@gmail.com)  
   - Provide as much information as possible, including:
     - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
     - Potential impact of the vulnerability.
     - Any possible mitigation steps or fixes, if known.

3. **Expect a response within 48 hours.**  
   We will acknowledge your report and provide updates on our investigation. After identifying and fixing the issue, we will release a security patch as soon as possible.

4. **Responsible disclosure.**  
   We ask that you do not disclose details about the vulnerability until a fix has been released.
